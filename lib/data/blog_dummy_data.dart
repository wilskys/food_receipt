Storing ingredients correctly helps maintain freshness, taste, and nutrition.

Vegetables & fruits  
Keep vegetables in the crisper drawer and separate fruits that release ethylene gas, like bananas and apples.

Meat & seafood  
Store raw meat in sealed containers on the lowest shelf of the fridge to avoid cross-contamination.

Dry ingredients  
Rice, flour, and spices should be stored in airtight containers away from heat and moisture.

Herbs  
Wrap fresh herbs in damp paper towels and keep them in a sealed bag for longer freshness.

Proper storage not only saves money but also improves food safety and quality.
